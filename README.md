# Dream Defenders Voter Registration Dashboard
## May 2024
Dream Defenders is running a Statewide Voter Registration. This repository supports the organization with processing voter registration data stored in Blocks, and preparing it for visualization in Looker.

## File Organization
This repository is organized as follows:
* blocks_transform: contains code for transforming the Blocks output file to a ready-to-use file for Looker (clean_blocks.csv), as well as the file that runs the Streamlit app (file_transform.py)
* census_analysis: contains code and file for creating a census summary page in the Looker dashboard
